Create An Account Form

This repository contains the code for a simple "Create An Account" form that I designed as part of my audition for the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC). The form allows users to input their email and password to register, with a clean and user-friendly interface.

Features
Email Input Field: Users can provide their email address to register.
Password Input Field: A password field ensures user privacy while registering.
Create Account Button: Submits the form to create the account.
Login Link: Redirects users who already have an account to the login page.

Technologies Used
HTML5 for the structure of the webpage.
CSS3 for styling the form (external file: up.css).
Ionicons for icons used in the email and password fields
