# 🌟 Create An Account Form

Welcome to the **Create An Account Form** repository, a sleek and minimal user registration interface built as part of my audition for the **Google Developer Student Club (GDSC)**! 🚀

This form provides a clean, responsive design that enhances the user experience, allowing seamless account creation with just an email and password. 

## ✨ Features

- 📧 **Email Input Field**: Users can easily provide their email addresses in a clean, user-friendly input box.
- 🔒 **Password Input Field**: Designed with security in mind, the password field hides the input and ensures privacy while users register.
- ➡️ **Create Account Button**: A stylish button to submit the form and initiate the account creation process.
- 🔗 **Login Redirect**: Already have an account? Click the "Login" link to swiftly navigate to the login page.
  
## 🎨 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structured the form using modern and semantic HTML5 tags.
- **CSS3**: Styled the form beautifully with an external CSS file (`up.css`) for a polished look.
- **Ionicons**: Added intuitive icons for the email and password fields to enhance visual feedback.
